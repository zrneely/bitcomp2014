Websites we should all take a look at go here. Whteher they be informative or have designs or ideas we could cop--err, modify, we should be doing some active reading.
If you want to add a website, include with a note on why it's important.
Lastly, try not to clutter with too much--keep readings critical and informative.

http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin -- a better read than the official site for must-know facts about bitcoin, implementation, and usage of coin.
https://play.google.com/store/search?q=bitcoin&c=apps -- know what's out there already! Not much....
http://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-wallet-apps-re-enter-ios-store-apples-digital-currency-policy-shift/ -- Apple has recently changed their policy on bitcoin apps to be much more firendly. However, it's still a touchy situation so we should monitor it while we decide which platforms to move on.
